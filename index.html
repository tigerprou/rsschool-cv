                    <p> Initially, I only knew about programming that it existed. <br /> After a while, I met many friends who were either studying or already working as programmers, and they told me about it, how it works, what is required of you and what qualities are needed.<br /> 
     I was very interested in this topic and I decided to try and figure it out on my own. <br /> 
     When I started learning Python by simply rewriting a calculator or currency converter, I realized that this was completely insufficient and that I needed to study this area more deeply.  <br /> 
     While I was starting to study Phyton, I was still studying in college and there was a very serious failure in my studies and work, which is why I was unable to continue studying programming...  <br /> 
    2 years later, when I was about to go to university, an acquaintance told me about rsscool, which he himself graduated from, and I finally decided that I wanted to study and work in the field of programming. <br />
     I believe that I am capable of studying this somewhat new specialty for me and that I will be able to work in this field </p> <br />
